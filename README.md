# matrix for linkedin
#Networking on LinkedIn is an incredible mechanism for career growth. Unfortunately, the process for building the network and staying in touch is tedious and time consuming.

I have created this chrome extension to automate the most time consuming tasks - connecting on LinkedIn, sending messages, following up - and help users be more efficient in their outreach. Currently it works for automatically adding people in your 2nd degree network. All you have to do is go to people page on linkedin and filter for 2nd degree connection and click a button and the extension will automatically add everyone in the page.

To add this code to your chrome browser, download the files as a zip from the drop down menu and load it unpacked from developer mode on chrome.

#If this project helped you save time, you can buy me a cup of coffee :)
